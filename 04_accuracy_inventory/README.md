## 07.11.2024 (Field Day)

### Field Day (Max, Teja, Jon): 13:00-17:00 +-

- Debriefing field exercise on position determination
- Discussion on GPS inaccuracy (approx. 15 minutes)
- Collecting / experiences / discussion
- Preliminary discussion on Mooswald inventory (1 hour)
- Jon Sheppard takes over (some may know him from previous semesters)
- Briefing on procedures and tasks
- Field exercise inventory in Mooswald (species, DBH, position, etc.)
- Bring food
- Measure each plot 2-3 times
- Wear sturdy footwear, etc.
- Formation of several student groups
- Groups switch to the next plot after inventorying the current plot, so that multiple inventories per plot are available for comparison in the debriefing (e.g., n=3 with 3 runs). For example, with 8 groups, there are 8 plots. Group 1 starts at 1, 2 at 2, etc... then group 1 moves to 2, 2 to 3, etc...

### Homework

**Calculate and submit inventory metrics (e.g., stem density, DBH, basal area) (e.g., Google Sheet)**

As announced, here is a link to download the Excel sheet (Google Sheet) and fill in the fields.

Please
- download the document via File -> Download -> (as Excel or Open Document file, for example)

- enter your 2 measured plots from today neatly
- and upload the completed sheet here:

You can also upload the locations there if you haven't already sent them to me by email or put them onto the sheets. It's best to do all this today or by tomorrow at the latest, so I can prepare the data for next week.
