## 07.11.2024 (Field Day)

### Field Day (Max, Teja, Jon): 10:00-14:00 +-

- Debriefing field exercise on position determination
- Discussion on GPS inaccuracy (approx. 15 minutes)
- Collecting / experiences / discussion
- Preliminary discussion on Mooswald inventory (1 hour)
- Jon Sheppard takes over (some may know him from previous semesters)
- Briefing on procedures and tasks
- Field exercise inventory in Mooswald (species, DBH, position, etc.)
- Bring food
- Measure each plot 2-3 times
- Wear sturdy footwear, etc.
- Formation of several student groups
- Groups switch to the next plot after inventorying the current plot, so that multiple inventories per plot are available for comparison in the debriefing (e.g., n=3 with 3 runs). For example, with 8 groups, there are 8 plots. Group 1 starts at 1, 2 at 2, etc... then group 1 moves to 2, 2 to 3, etc...

### Homework

- Calculate and submit inventory metrics (e.g., stem density, DBH, basal area) (e.g., Google Sheet)
