- Introduction and history
- Estimation of wood stock, biomass, modeling, predictions, etc.

- From DBH â†’ biomass/wood stock (needed for exercises)

### Exercise: Allometries and wood stock in R (Max, Teja)

- Apply allometries to full inventory ECOSENSE based on the R scripts from the previous week
- Evaluate and discuss the impact of sampling uncertainties on allometries
