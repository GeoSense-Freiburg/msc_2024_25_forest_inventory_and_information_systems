# M.Sc. Inventories and Applied Geomatics
## General Course Information

https://campus.uni-freiburg.de:443/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=126509&periodId=2483&navigationPosition=examEventOverviewOwn

Start 17.10.24

Thursday 13-17 Uhr in Herderbau (R 400, 4th floor)

Bring a laptop. If not available, work in a team.
Install QGIS (version 3.34 LTR!) and RStudio.
Here on GitHub, you will find all the materials for the course. The topics are numbered, and a new folder with a number will be added weekly. For example, today the folder "01_intro" is relevant. In general, there will always be a README.md file in each of these folders, where you can directly see on GitHub what it's about. In the "lecture" folder, there are slides and lecture materials, and in the "exercises" folder, you will find exercises to download.

So the filesystem will be as follows:

```
01_intro
-- lecture
-- -- example_slide.pdf
-- -- ...
-- exercise
-- -- exercise_1
-- -- ...
-- README.md
```

# News

## 07.11.2024 (Field Day)

folder: 04_accuracy_inventory

### Field Day (Max, Teja, Jon): 13:00-17:00 +-

- Debriefing field exercise on position determination
- Discussion on GPS inaccuracy (approx. 15 minutes)
- Collecting / experiences / discussion
- Preliminary discussion on Mooswald inventory (1 hour)
- Jon Sheppard takes over (some may know him from previous semesters)
- Briefing on procedures and tasks
- Field exercise inventory in Mooswald (species, DBH, position, etc.)
- Bring food
- Measure each plot 2-3 times
- Wear sturdy footwear, etc.
- Formation of several student groups
- Groups switch to the next plot after inventorying the current plot, so that multiple inventories per plot are available for comparison in the debriefing (e.g., n=3 with 3 runs). For example, with 8 groups, there are 8 plots. Group 1 starts at 1, 2 at 2, etc... then group 1 moves to 2, 2 to 3, etc...

### Homework

- Calculate and submit inventory metrics (e.g., stem density, DBH, basal area) (e.g., Google Sheet)
**see readme file in folder 04**

## 31.10.2024

folder: 03_gnss

## Lecture Block (Thomas P.):

- Position determination
- Introduction to satellite-based positioning
- Why is positioning important for inventories?
- GPS, GLONASS, BEIDOU, GALILEO +
- GNSS uncertainties and influencing factors
- Hemisphere, North, South, On which side of the sky to measure trees?
- Distance/shading from trees
- Minimizing GNSS uncertainties
- RTK, SAPOS, Rover, Base station, Postprocessing

## Exercise Block (Max): Field Exercise!

- **Field exercise** on GNSS
- Groups of 2 people
    - One person tracks, one measures points (circuit around Schlossberg)
- Introduction to EmlidReach, Base, Rover (before the exercise)

What you need:

- **Weatherproof clothing**
- Smartphone
- Avenza Maps App (please download!)
- Materials in folder 03_gnss/exercises

**Meeting point behind Kanonenplatz (https://maps.app.goo.gl/1t6J6wnk2cSg4bkt7) punctually at 15:00 (please try to be there slightly earlier so we can start directly).**

Rough schedule:

- Start at 15:00
- Approx. 15-20 minutes introduction to Emlid Reach Base and Rover
- Independently complete the circuit (approx. 1.5h) and track the points and path using Avenza Maps.
- After the exercise, immediately upload the CSV and GPX online and review the results
- Send CSV and GPX to Max by email (as a backup in case the online app does not work)


## October 24, 2024: Lecture Block (Thomas P.):

- Which inventory method (angle count sampling, etc.)?
- Determination of the inventory scope (number of samples/plots)
- Positioning of inventory points
- Regular grid
- Random samples
- Stratification? (e.g., by stands/forest types/topography)
