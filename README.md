# M.Sc. Inventories and Applied Geomatics
## General Course Information

https://campus.uni-freiburg.de:443/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=126509&periodId=2483&navigationPosition=examEventOverviewOwn

Start 17.10.24

Thursday 13-17 Uhr in Herderbau (R 400, 4th floor)

Bring a laptop. If not available, work in a team.
Install QGIS (version 3.34 LTR!) and RStudio.
Here on GitHub, you will find all the materials for the course. The topics are numbered, and a new folder with a number will be added weekly. For example, today the folder "01_intro" is relevant. In general, there will always be a README.md file in each of these folders, where you can directly see on GitHub what it's about. In the "lecture" folder, there are slides and lecture materials, and in the "exercises" folder, you will find exercises to download.

So the filesystem will be as follows:

```
01_intro
-- lecture
-- -- example_slide.pdf
-- -- ...
-- exercise
-- -- exercise_1
-- -- ...
-- README.md
```
